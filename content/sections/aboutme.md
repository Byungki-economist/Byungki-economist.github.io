I am an Assistant Professor at the [Department of Economics](http://economics.harvard.edu/) at Harvard University. I graduated from UC Berkeley with a PhD in Economics in 2014. 

My research tries to bring insights from psychology to bear on topics in economics, particularly topics relevant to developing countries. Recent projects include studying how a demand for social status affects consumption decision in Indonesia, how mixing rich and poor students in schools in India affects social preferences and behaviors, how citizens in the United States are motivated to vote by social image concerns, and how the endowment effect influences consumer demand and repayment of  different types of collateralized loans.

I presently serve as an Associate Editor at the *Journal of Political Economy*. I am a Faculty Research Fellow at the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER), and a faculty affiliate at the The Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Action Lab (JPAL).
