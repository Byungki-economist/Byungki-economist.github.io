      Abstract We design three field experiments to estimate the nature and magnitude of workers’ social preferences towards their employers. The experiments vary the piece rates paid to workers, the return to the employer, and employer generosity towards workers (“gifts”). The piece-rate design allows us to estimate the elasticity of work outcomes to monetary incentives and thus benchmark the workers' social preferences toward the employer. The first experiment measures productivity—units of output produced in a fixed amount of time. The second and third experiments measure the willingness to do extra work. We document that productivity is rather unresponsive to financial incentives, while the willingness to perform extra work is very responsive. In terms of social preferences, we document, first, that workers exert effort for their employer even in the absence of private incentives, but are insensitive to the return to the employer. This result is consistent with models of warm glow or social norms regarding work effort, but not pure altruism towards the employer. Second, while we do not detect any effect of the gifts in the productivity experiment, we find moderate positive impacts in the extra-work experiments. We show that this difference is partly explained by disparate elasticities of productivity and extra work.
